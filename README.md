Sphere is a digital game where the player guides a sphere through a series of physics, reaction, and spatial reasoning challenges.

Built in collaboration with a group of developers as senior thesis project within the University of Illinois: Urbana-Champaign College of Engineering Computer Science program, Sphere is written from scratch C++ on top of OpenGL, OpenAL, and SDL.
